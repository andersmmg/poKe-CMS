What is this?
---------------------

* PoKe is another special type of **Content Management System** (CMS) which allows you to build powerful websites and  online applications that can make everyones lives easier.
* It only requires basic server tools like apache2, php5, and  a mysql-server.
poKe allows you to create a very awesome website that is great quality and uses bootstrap. It creates a simple user interface for developing and creating a website. This script uses MySQL, bootstrap, and PHP.

This script is based off an old script that had very bad code and design, this system does the same things, but better and cleaner.

Updates are free!
---------------------
Our updates use the powerful tecflare cdnpackage server which is hosted by our friends at sixserve. This server holds all of the files and updates which can be listed. The requirements for using the cdnpackage is this:

* A working internet connection
* file_get_contents, and write permissions are allowed

##Installation
The installation is very easy. All you have to do is to go into your browser with your site url /install.
After you are complete delete your install director.
